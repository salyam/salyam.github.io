Hi!
My name is Salyámosy, András, and currently I am working for evosoft Hungary Kft. as a test engineer: I am the main developer of an integration testing framework made in C# and C++. Our testing software infrastructure consists of more than 10 apps at the time. My team is responsible for maintaining a stable and predictable test environment, executing test scripts, measuring performance indicators and much more. Our main product, the integration test framework itself supports scenarios when a single test spans across multiple physical machines.

I am also a student of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in the field of Computer Sciences / Computer Engineering. Besides learning there, I help in teaching of several subjects every semester - in the previous years I have participated in teaching linear algebra, graph theory, algorithm theory, and programming in C and C++. Since I help teaching in these subjects, I plan to publish several tutorial on this blog, however, many of them may be written in hungarian, since my students are also hungarian.
